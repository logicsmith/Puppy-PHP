Create        Read        Update        Delete

##Primary Model
One-to-One: Additional Fields
Many-to-One: Drop Downs
One-to-Many: CRUD Operation, Search & Selection of Items to Include
Many-to-Many: Selection of Items to Include on Both Ends

##Things to Consider
Inactive Records vs. Deleted Records
Link to Parent Record on Inactive Record
Create Timestamp
Change Log Design: Record Update Create New Records & Relink
Unset Settings â€“ Create if unset or Update
Models & Form I/O should be held together by a tree like array structure
Form I/O Has to store links to sub model ids

##Design Pattern for Controller/Action
Check if User has authorization to use this application
Check if User has authorization to perform this type of action
Check if record being Updated, Viewed, or Deleted belongs to user or the users organization
Init Form I/O
Configure Field Validators & Insert Points for Model Errors
Acquire Primary Model & Sub Models, Linking Sub Models to Primary Model if In Update, or View Mode
If Primary Record is in Update or View Mode Then
	Load Model Data into Form I/O
If Form Submitted(Token) & Valid Then{
    Update Models with Form I/O Data
    Begin Database Transaction
    Try {
        If Save Primary Model Succeeded
            Get Primary Key
        Link Applicable Sub Model Records to Primary Model
        Save Sub Models
		Commit Database Transaction
		Load Model & Sub Model Ids into Form I/O
		//Redirect if desired
	}
	Catch {
	    Rollback Database Transaction
	    Add Model Error Messages to Form I/O 
		//Debug Helpers
	}
}
//If Form is not valid, error messages will automatically be passed to Form I/O
Query & Supply Form I/O with Option List for Many-to-One Dropdowns
Output View for Selected Model (Create, Read, or Update)
//Delete for Primary Record should be handled in separate actions

Roles should be a Tree One-to-Many Self Relationship
And Roles to Privileges should be a Many-to-Many Relationship
Privileges should be individual actions in controllers plus addition custom ones added for detail programing
Privileges should not be assignable to users but only role groups
